**Personal background**  
Namaskar/Greetings Fellow's:  
I was born and raised in Nepal, a country known for Himalaya and the birthplace of Buddha.I finished my undergraduate degree in Agriculture science with focus on plant breeding. Then, I joined West Virginia State University (WVSU)for my MS in Biotechnology. At WVSU, I worked on improving vintage tomato varieties using Marker assisted selection and background selection. I also worked on incompatibility issues while crossing heirlooms with the commercial variety. After graduating from WVSU, I joined Cornell University for my doctoral degree. I started from fall of 2023 in the field of plant breeding and genetics. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student in Robbins lab, where my research focuses on using advanced statistical models, quantitative genetics, and sensor data for modeling crop growth and plant-environment interactions, working on alfalfa, maize, soybean, cotton, and canola.
